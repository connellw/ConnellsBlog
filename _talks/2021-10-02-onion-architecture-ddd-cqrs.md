Explaining how I reason about the building blocks of Onion Architecture, Domain-Driven Design and Command Query Responsibility Segregation in an event-driven microservices architecture. How it all fits together in my head, the concepts they share, and the mistakes I've made along the way.

I summarised this talk in a [blog post with the same title](/onion-architecture-ddd-cqrs) a few days after.
