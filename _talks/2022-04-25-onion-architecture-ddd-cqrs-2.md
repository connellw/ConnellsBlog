A remote version of my [Onion Architecture talk from DDD East Midlands](/talks/onion-architecture-ddd-cqrs/) with a few extra slides.

Explaining how I reason about the building blocks of Onion Architecture, Domain-Driven Design and Command Query Responsibility Segregation in an event-driven microservices architecture. How it all fits together in my head, the concepts they share, and the mistakes I've made along the way.
