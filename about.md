I mainly write web applications using **C#** and **JavaScript**. I try to follow best practices, focus on object design and pride myself in writing standardised and readable code. The perfectionist type..

This blog will contain thoughts about architecture, tools, practices, processes, crazy ideas and maybe some nasty duct-tape code *just to get it working for now*.
