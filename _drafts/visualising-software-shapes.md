- Note that these layers are not necessarily csproj.

When I think of a software system, I see shapes and lines connecting groups of smaller shapes and smaller lines, like a galaxy of solar systems with planets of continents, each with city roads. It's a structure that fits related concepts together and hides away complexity at different scales.

Sometimes I wonder if everyone views systems like this. We [whiteboard boxes and arrows](/drawing-boxes) to explain the shapes of these structures. These visual cues help imagine how these systems fit together and where things might live within a solution.

# Hexagonal Architecture

Ports and Adapters was originally called the Hexagonal Architecture. There is nothing special about the number six here, it is just a nice way to visualise the architecture. It's diagrams tend to use a hexagon in the middle, but the shape doesn't matter; it can just as easily be drawn as a circle.

..... bit on driving and driven adapters ?? .....

# Onion Architecture

Onion Architecture is just Ports and Adapters architecture, but the business logic layer is further divided into domain logic and application logic.

I had a go myself once.

# Vertical Slice Architecture

- Note horizontal and vertical slices ?
