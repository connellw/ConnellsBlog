Great engineers truly care about what it is they're building. Not just the end result, making a customer happy and getting paid. They enjoy the engineering process, they love the tools they use, and they get a kick out of actually ___________.

> If you do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life.

The best engineers know the tiny details in their tools. They know exactly when to use a hammer and when to use a drill. In software engineering, our tools are our language features, frameworks, design patterns and practices.

The best software engineers don't just solve problems, they build well-crafted solutions. They write code not just for the customer, but also for their future selves and for their peers who maintain the solution as it evolves. They make it clear, concise, intentional, understandable and maintainable.

Well-crafted doesn't mean perfect. We will still get things wrong, through inexperience with a new tool or through experimentation, and we will learn from it, becoming experts in everything in our toolkit. We'll get good, but perhaps counter-intuitively to some, we'll get **fast**.

# We need to get this done quick

By far the most common push-back is, "we need to get this done quick", assuming that means trading off against doing it well.

It's usually pedalled by project managers, sometimes even by other engineers, and often served with a side of misunderstood agile jargon.

Sometimes it's *"only the MVP"*. The purpose of releasing a Minimum Viable Product is to get feedback for future development, so if this statement is meant to be an reason not to write well-crafted code, then it assumes that code quality improves over time. Unless there is a healthy culture of refactoring regularly, the idea of software entropy will be true, and the quality will deteriorate over time.

One way to avoid that is the promise of "repaying tech debt" later. We'll add something to the backlog. Let's be honest, this rarely happens. Usually because the person making the promise sees "tech debt" as something the engineer wants to do, and doesn't see the value.

The phrase "tactical solution" has somehow became synonymous with a workaround. Tactics are **the concrete steps you take towards a strategic goal**, not something you do in lieu of a strategy.

# Duct tape

Don't get me wrong, duct tape has its place. If there is a hole in the water pipe, and the room is beginning to flood, a great engineer's first action wouldn't be to drive to the nearest plumbing supply store and buy a replacement pipe. Put a plaster on it, stop it leaking first, *then* get your proper fix done.

One-off solutions that no-one will ever use again, sure.
